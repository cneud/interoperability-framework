# The variables below can be used in the template code and configuration files.
# For example, the variable global.wrapper.version is ${global_wrapper_version}
# in the template files ('$'-prefix, in angle brackets, and replacing '.' by '_').
# Note also that there are derived variables documented in this file with
# the comment prefix "#derived:" which means that the value of this variable
# also determines the value of derived variables created by string conversions.

# Toolwrapper properties

# Wrapper version helps identifying which version of the wrapper was used
# to generate the code.

# A global prefix that identifies the global project for which different
# tool wrappers are created
